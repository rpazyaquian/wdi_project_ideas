# Project Ideas - 10-4-2014

* A program that tells me whether I should commute via C train or D train in the morning.
  * St. Paul's Street is right next to my apartment, but Fenway is relatively close by and has less stops/more seats. Which do I take?
  * Will choose the option that takes less total time, including walking time to the stop.
* A program that reliably blocks people on Twitter and prevents them from showing up in your timeline.
  * Even through retweets.
  * Tweets written by those people do not appear in your timeline.
  * Those tweets retweeted by others do not appear in your timeline.
  * Should mentions appear in your timeline? Maybe leave this up to the user.
  * "you could have a mute function to mute all tweets in which that person is @'d"
